Now with a goal of 70% gross margin, my guess is the companies will come together next year somewhere in the range of low 60s gross margin, and then what we've been able to do as a company at Sonus prior to becoming Ribbon is do about 200 basis points a year. That would be about the cadence that I'd hope to get the entire revenue stream margin towards 70%.
