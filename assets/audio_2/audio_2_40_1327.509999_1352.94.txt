I don't think there will be too much disruption but I feel comfortable as the Sonus SBC platform, as it's virtualized, will be the fundamental platform. There's a tremendous opportunity and the teams have been working real hard to integrate a lot of very powerful GENBAND technology and talent into that road map, and then you'll see the application server and the Kandy CPaaS platform play out in a unified offer.
