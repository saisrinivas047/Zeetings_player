And then maybe if I could kind of go back to the preannouncement initially and kind of the reduction in the GENBAND's guide, which came down about $20 million from the initial thought when you filed your S-4. Would you sort of explain what happened there and maybe you're still early (20:00) that you didn't see all the kind of puts and takes of that business, or what exactly happened? And I do think I caught you say that you weren't ready or prepared to say something at this moment and you will next quarter, was that related to this exact reduction in the outlook or any detail on that would be very helpful (20:20).
