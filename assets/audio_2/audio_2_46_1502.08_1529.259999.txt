It's important to emphasize again our previous disclosures, which is GENBAND's bulk of its revenue is in its NTr product portfolio sold as a (25:14) solution, and that includes softswitch, media gateway and telephony application servers bundled in different ways depending on the architecture or needs of the solution itself with any particular telecom carrier. So the mix will change quite a bit.
