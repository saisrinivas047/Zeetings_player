It probably will open an opportunity for us, which we, frankly, already had but it'll create an opportunity for us to compete better and maybe even replace those solutions in some of their service provider networks as we bring an entire suite of products from SBCs and gateways all the way up to Kandy. So I think it's a great opportunity for us to stay focused, continue to invest and drive better financial performance ourselves.
